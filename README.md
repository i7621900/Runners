A University assignment which uses Allegro and C++

This assignment was to create a basic game using Allegro 4 to show how my skill in C++ had improved. 
Basic skills such as classes and objects were needed. 
This is a very basic game which I created when I just started learning meaning the code might look bad and inefficient. 

For any hints and tips on how this can be improved,
Please either visit my website: http://connorfletcher.net/

Thank you for viewing my code.
